2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate into the main folder and run ```npm install``` to get all the dependencies

## Notes
This app is developed in 15.60-inch screen 1920x1080 px environment and has not been responsively optimized.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
